# HeadlessWP Child Theme
This is a [HeadlessWP](https://github.com/cloak-labs/headless-wp-theme) child theme that comes with many commonly used ACF Blocks + Field Groups, Gutenberg theme customizations, and more. Its goal is to speed up the initial scaffolding of your headless WordPress project.

After cloning, make sure to:
- Modify the Gutenberg theme customizations in `theme.json` (add your own color palette, font sizes, and other Gutenberg feature preferences). The default configuration leans heavily towards stripping down the available editing capabilities.
-  

This theme is ideally used in conjunction with the [CloakWP NPM package](https://github.com/kaelansmith/cloakwp) and its corresponding [CloakWP WordPress plugin](https://github.com/Stikky-Media/cloakwp-plugins/).
